# IMDB-Movie-review-classification
IMDB dataset is a movie dataset in which we have reviews given by people. This project basically detects whether a review given by a person is positive or negative.
I have used multi-layer perceptron for classifying movie reviews. First, I have prepared the data by vectorising x-train and x-test, also i have converted y-train and y-test into numpy arrays.Then the data is fed into MLP.
This project achieves an accuracy of 87.344 percent on test data.
